Certificate Transparency (CT) is a system and framework designed to enhance the security and reliability of digital certificates used in secure communications on the internet, particularly in the context of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates.

The concept of Certificate Transparency was introduced by Google in 2013 as a means to address various issues and vulnerabilities associated with the current certificate infrastructure. It aims to provide an open and publicly auditable log of all certificates issued by certificate authorities (CAs). The primary goals of CT are to detect and prevent the misissuance of certificates, monitor the behavior of CAs, and improve the overall trustworthiness of the certificate ecosystem.

In the traditional certificate issuance process, a CA can issue a certificate for any domain without the knowledge or consent of the domain owner. This creates opportunities for malicious actors to issue fraudulent certificates, which can be used for various malicious activities such as phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and website spoofing. Certificate Transparency helps mitigate these risks by making the issuance and existence of certificates more transparent.

The CT framework requires CAs to publish all issued certificates to publicly accessible and append-only logs, which can be monitored by anyone. These logs contain detailed information about each certificate, including the domain name, the issuing CA, the certificate's validity period, and cryptographic proof of the certificate's inclusion in the log. Additionally, these logs are digitally signed to ensure their integrity.

By monitoring these logs, domain owners, security researchers, and other stakeholders can detect unauthorized or fraudulent certificates issued for their domains. They can verify that the certificates issued for their domains are legitimate and identify any suspicious activity by CAs. The transparency provided by CT also encourages CAs to adhere to best practices and maintain a higher level of accountability.

To further strengthen the security and reliability of CT, the system incorporates a mechanism called "Certificate Transparency Monitoring" (CTM). CTM involves regularly monitoring the logs for newly issued certificates and verifying their integrity and compliance with CT standards. CTM services can notify domain owners when new certificates are issued for their domains, allowing them to quickly detect and respond to any unauthorized certificate issuance.

In summary, Certificate Transparency is a framework that aims to increase the security and trustworthiness of digital certificates by providing transparency into the certificate issuance process. By making certificate issuance publicly auditable, it helps detect and prevent the misuse of certificates, strengthens accountability of CAs, and enhances the overall security of online communications.
