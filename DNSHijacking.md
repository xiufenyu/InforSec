Domain hijacking and DNS poisoning are two methods used by threat actors to perform a DNS spoofing attack and redirect traffic toward malicious websites. They are both serious threats as they can be used to steal sensitive information, send visitors to a fake version of a website and even take it offline completely.

In this article, we’ll take a look at the differences and similarities between the two, what they are, how they work, their impact, and how you can protect yourself or your business against them.
What Is Domain Hijacking?

Domain hijacking, also called “domain theft”, is a type of DNS spoofing in which a threat actor steals a domain name by changing the DNS registration to point the domain to a different server.

Domain name hijacking can be accomplished in a number of ways, including through unauthorized access to, or exploiting a flaw in the domain name registrar’s system, via social engineering, or by gaining access to the email account of the domain owner.

Domain hijackers frequently use impersonation to pose as the legitimate owner of a domain in an effort to change the registrant’s contact information or transfer the domain to another registrar. Once they have control of the domain, they can use it in any way they want, including selling it, redirecting it to a malicious website, or using it for email spam or phishing attacks.

It can also be used to prevent the victim from accessing their own website. Domain hijacking can be very costly for businesses since it can result in lost revenue, customers, and reputation.
What Is DNS Poisoning?

DNS Poisoning or “DNS Cache Poisoning” on the other hand, achieves DNS spoofing without taking over the DNS settings (like in the case of domain hijacking). Instead, it focuses on the DNS records – changing them, which results in the domain resolving the wrong IP address.

This can be used to redirect traffic intended for the legitimate website to a malicious website, where the attacker can attempt to steal sensitive information or infect visitors with malware.

DNS poisoning attacks are typically carried out by compromising a DNS server and changing the records it contains, or by spoofing DNS responses so that victims receive incorrect DNS information. DNS poisoning can also be used to block access to websites, as attackers can simply redirect visitors to a non-existent page.
Domain Hijacking vs DNS Poisoning: Similarities

Both attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the Domain Name System (DNS) to redirect traffic intended for a legitimate website to a malicious site. This can allow attackers to collect sensitive information such as login credentials, or infect visitors with malware.

Both domain hijacking and DNS poisoning can be difficult to detect, as they often occur without any obvious signs. And both attacks can have serious consequences for website owners and visitors alike. If you suspect that your website has been hijacked or your DNS records have been poisoned, it’s important to take action quickly to minimize the damage.
Domain Hijacking vs DNS Poisoning: Differences

1. Domain hijacking changes the DNS settings, while DNS poisoning modifies the DNS records.

Domain hijacking occurs when an attacker gains control of a domain name and changes its DNS settings. This can be done by breaking into the account of the domain registrar or by using social engineering techniques to trick the registrar into changing the DNS settings. Once the attacker has changed the DNS settings, they can redirect traffic meant for the victim domain to their own servers.

DNS poisoning occurs when an attacker modifies a DNS server’s records so that it resolves queries incorrectly. For example, an attacker could modify a DNS server’s records so that when someone tries to visit www.example.com, they are actually directed to a malicious site instead. This type of attack is often used to redirect users from legitimate websites to fake ones in order to steal sensitive information like login credentials or credit card numbers.

2. Domain hijacking tends to be more disruptive since it can completely shut down a website.

Both attacks can have a significant impact on targets, but domain hijacking tends to be more disruptive because it might cause a website to go offline entirely, once complete control over the domain is achieved.

DNS poisoning can be just as damaging, but it is often used as part of a larger attack where multiple domains are poisoned to redirect traffic to a single malicious site, and only some requests may be redirected depending on how the records were modified.
How to Protect Yourself from Domain Hijacking and DNS Poisoning

Domain hijacking and DNS poisoning are two of the most common methods used by attackers to gain control of a website or redirect traffic to a malicious site. There are a few steps you can take to prevent these attacks:
